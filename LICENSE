Let's be real here: you could have written this code yourself.
It just would have taken you the better part of a day to consider it done.
There is nothing original or complicated or copyrightable here,
this code is in the public domain and if you live in a place that doesn't
recognize the public domain, then I hereby grant you a perpetual,
non-exclusive right to use this code as if it were your own.
